*Resume Django Web Application*

I developed an understanding of web application languages (namely HTML, JS and CSS/SCSS) during some web scraping analyses, 
and became even more motivated to learn some JS through some custome visualisations I'd seen evidenced in ML projects. As a result, I figured it would make sense to build a web application to evidence some portfolio work in an engaging way (as much as I love github...) and really drill down into some javascript. 

As expected, the repo utilises the django framework to build a web application and utilises embeddings in order to showcase some visualisations used in previous projects.

Whilst still a work in progress, this is the current product:
